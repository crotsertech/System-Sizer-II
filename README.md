## 💧 What is System Sizer II?

**System Sizer II** is a free and open-source web-based tool designed to estimate the correct water softener size based on real-world parameters:

- Water hardness (gpg)
- Iron (ppm)
- Manganese (ppm)
- Number of people in the home
- Use of **Ecosoft ECOMIX C** media

It uses EPA 2025 estimates (82 gallons/day/person) and adjusts for iron and manganese content to recommend:

- **Resin volume (cu ft)**
- **Softener capacity (grains)**
- **Estimated gallons between regenerations**

## ⚠️ Important Notice
